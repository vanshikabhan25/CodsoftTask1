The computer will think of a random number from 1 to 100 and ask you to guess it.
The computer will tell you if each guess is too high or too low. You win if you can guess the number.
This is a good game to code because it uses random numbers. 
You can play again multiple rounds. You can exit the game and the code will be executed.
